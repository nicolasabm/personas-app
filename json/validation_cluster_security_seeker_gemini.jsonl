You have the opportunity to invest a portion (or all) of this bonus in an improvement project for the department (such as new software, training, or equipment). \n    The rule is as follows: every dollar invested in the common project will be doubled by the company, and the final amount will be divided equally among the four team members, regardless of who contributed.\n        Example 1: If everyone invests their full $2,000, the total in the project fund will be $8,000. The company will double it to $16,000, and each of the four members will receive $4,000 back.\n        Example 2: If you invest $1,000 and the other three invest nothing, the total in the project fund will be $1,000. The company will double it to $2,000. Each member will receive $500. In this case, your final outcome would be $1,500 (the $1,000 you didnt invest + $500 from the project), while the others would end up with $2,500 each.\n    Of your $2,000, what amount would you decide to invest in the common department project?"}]}, {"role": "model", "parts": [{"text": "Invested US$0, I contribute with nothing, prioritizing personal gain over team benefit."}]}]}
